# GROUP AGREEMENT
Communication plan: 
<!IMPORTANT>Try to not talk over eachother as much as possible.
Talk every subject fully through before moving on to a new one.

Conflict plan:
Every decision needs 75% Majority vote. Strive for unanimous, 
by explaining our decision in depth to the dissenting party, and fully hear their rebuttal.

Work plan:
Work-assignment party 3-4 times a day.
First come first serve, if someone's excited about a certain feature, they're welcome to it. 
If someone needs partners for a project, we will adjust accordingly. breaks are up to each individual, 
but they should checkout with the group, and keep their phone on them. lunch between 12:30-1:30

Git process:
All work will be done in feature branches.
Only one computer should be working on any specific file. 
These files will be decided at each work assignment party. 
2 reviews on PRs, and anyone other than the pusher can merge a PR. 
No feature should be merged to the master branch until every member has reviewed it.
