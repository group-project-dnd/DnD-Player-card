                    <p>I was born in beautiful Seattle, growing up loving fantasy and people. Before codefellows, I went to University of Portland, Donald P Shiley college of Mechanical Engineering graduating with a BSME, and due to personal happiness, went into retail because I love people. Along the way, I have always had my heart in sports and education. I played ultimate frisbee when I went to college, and  while I worked retail, for a while I coached ultimate frisbee at Eckstein middle school. I am looking to learn and grow personally, and would like to keep an open mind for what my future holds.</p>

                    <p>Hey there, I'm Harry, the Code Wizard!
                        I grew up mainly in Lake Chelan, over the mountains, but have lived in quite a few different places. Santa Barbara, Portland, New York, and Seattle, but Seattle's always been my favorite, and I'm back to stay! Before Code Fellows, I pursued acting mainly, and musical theater. Went to a New York Acting Conservatory and everything! But since then, I've "settled down", you could say. I'm getting married in two years, and I want a more structured career and life; a house and kids, all that jazz! I live in Redmond, and walk through the Microsoft campus on the way to the bus every morning, and I keep hoping to get a job there after I graduate CF!</p>

                    <p> I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. Then I moved to Washington because I was given the chance to pursue a new career in the tech industry. Before Code-fellows I worked as a Automotive tech for an Audi Dealership. The reason I moved over to coding was actually to obtain a job where I can constantly keep learning and also just to give this a try, I've always thought coding was really cool and when I was given the chance to learn I took it. After Code-Fellows I would like to work anywhere I can really learn from as well as somewhere that I can contribute my on knowledge.</p>

                    <p>I grow up in Monroe, Washignton and still do. I w have a BA in Early Childhood Education from Trinity Lutheran College. Then I worked in childcare centers as a teacher. I decide to switch career because I want a better and healther life. In the future I hope to someday work as a software develper for Boeing, because as a child airplanes always fancatied me, so being able to work with planes in someway is like fulfilling a childhood dream</p>
